            <h1><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>

The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h3><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></h3>
            <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Android Advertising ID. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.</p>
            <p>The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
            <p>Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the app</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Play Services</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>Cookies</strong></h3>
            <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.</p>
            <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>

            <h3><strong>Service Providers</strong></h3>
            <p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>

            <h3><strong>Security</strong></h3>
            <p> I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving
                to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
                the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee
                its absolute security.

              <h3><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></h3>
              <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
                to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
                advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over
                and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites
                or services.
              </p> <h3><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></h3>
              <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect
                personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child
                under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from
                our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal
                information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
              </p> <h3><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></h3>

            <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2> 
            <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
                therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the
                app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
                source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make
                derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
                property rights related to it, still belong to Knight Games.</p> <p>Knight Games is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
                that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time
                and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear
                to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p> <p>The game stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide
                my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
                recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions
                and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
                to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that
                the game won’t work properly or at all. </p> <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Knight Games will not take responsibility
                for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
                can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Knight Games cannot take responsibility
                for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
                of your data allowance left.
                </p><p></p><p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
                    agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
                    your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
                    app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
                    charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region
                    or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
                    you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
                    payer for using the app.</p> <p>Along the same lines, Knight Games cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
                    the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
                    you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Knight Games cannot accept responsibility.</p> <p>With respect to Knight Games’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using
                    the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
                    correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
                    it available to you. Knight Games accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
                    you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p> <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the
                    requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability
                    of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
                    app. Knight Games does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
                    to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However,
                    you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
                    stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
                    to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
                    you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
                    device.
                  </p>

                    to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any
